# cosmos-sdk

## Introduction

Brief overview of what Cosmos SDK is and its purpose.
Explanation of its modular and interoperable design.

## Tools and Frameworks
The Cosmos ecosystem is vast. Awesome Cosmos is a community-curated list of notable frameworks, modules and tools.

### Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC module for the Cosmos SDK has its own [cosmos/ibc-go repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Go there to build and integrate with the IBC module.

### Version Matrix

The version matrix below shows which versions of the Cosmos SDK, modules and libraries are compatible with each other.

#### Core Dependencies

Core dependencies are the core libraries that an application may depend on.
Core dependencies not mentioned here as compatible across all maintained SDK versions.

| Cosmos SDK | cosmossdk.io/core | cosmossdk.io/api | cosmossdk.io/x/tx |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 0.52.z     | 1.y.z             | 0.8.z            | 1.y.z             |
| 0.50.z     | 0.11.z            | 0.7.z            | 0.13.z            |
| 0.47.z     | 0.5.z             | 0.3.z            | N/A               |

#### Module Dependencies

Module Dependencies are the modules that an application may depend on and which version of the Cosmos SDK they are compatible with.

> Note: The version table only goes back to 0.50.x, as modules started to become modular with 0.50.z.
> X signals that the module was not spun out into its own go.mod file.
> N/A signals that the module was not available in the Cosmos SDK at that time.

| Cosmos SDK                  | 0.50.z | 0.52.z |
